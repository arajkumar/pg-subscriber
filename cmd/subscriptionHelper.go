	Short: "Upstream subscription helper for TimescaleDB replication.",
	Long: `TimescaleDB extension for PostgreSQL creates chunk tables dynamically
	based on the data that is inserted into the hypertable. Since the upstream
	logical replication doesn't replicate DDL changes, the chunks that are
	created on the source need to be created on the target manually. This
	utility helps in creating the missing chunks on the target.

	Additionally, the chunks that are created on the source also need to be
	added to the publication so that the changes that are made to the chunk
	tables are replicated to the target. This utility also helps in adding the
	chunks to the publication.

	Finally, the utility refreshes the subscription on the target so that the
	changes that are made to the publication are replicated to the target.
